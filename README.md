  # Nutrition Planner App

  A modern, AI-powered nutrition planning application built with React and TypeScript, featuring scientifically validated calculations and OpenAI integration.

  ## 🧬 Scientific Foundation

  This app uses evidence-based formulas for all nutrition calculations:

  - **BMI**: Standard weight/height² formula
  - **BMR**: Mifflin-St Jeor equation (most accurate modern formula)
  - **TDEE**: BMR × scientifically validated activity multipliers
  - **Macros**: Evidence-based ratios optimized for different goals

  See [SCIENTIFIC_BASIS.md](./SCIENTIFIC_BASIS.md) for detailed scientific documentation.

  ## 🚀 Features

  - **AI-Powered Meal Suggestions**: Get personalized recommendations based on your profile
  - **Smart Meal Analysis**: AI analyzes your meal descriptions for accurate nutrition data
  - **Scientific Calculations**: Evidence-based BMI, BMR, TDEE, and macro calculations
  - **Data Persistence**: Your targets and meal logs are saved automatically
  - **Indian Cuisine Focus**: Optimized for Indian food items and nutrition patterns

  ## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

  ### Prerequisites
  - Node.js (v16 or higher)
  - OpenAI API Key (optional, for AI features)

  ### Installation
  ```bash
  # Install dependencies
  npm install

  # Set up environment variables (optional)
  echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here" > .env

  # Start both frontend and backend
  npm start
  ```

  ### Manual Setup
  ```bash
  # Start backend server
  node server.js

  # Start frontend (in another terminal)
  npm run dev
  ```

  ## 📱 Usage

  1. **Complete Onboarding**: Enter your profile information
  2. **View Targets**: See your calculated BMI, BMR, TDEE, and macro targets
  3. **Get AI Suggestions**: Use AI-powered meal recommendations
  4. **Log Meals**: Track your daily food intake
  5. **Monitor Progress**: Real-time tracking against your targets

  ## 🔬 Scientific Accuracy

  The app uses the most accurate and widely accepted formulas:

  - **Mifflin-St Jeor BMR equation** (validated in 1990, most accurate)
  - **Standard activity multipliers** (1.2-1.9 range)
  - **Evidence-based macro ratios** for different goals
  - **Sustainable caloric adjustments** (±300-500 kcal)
